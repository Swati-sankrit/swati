        oldest and most famous,renowned temple mahabodhi.Considered one of the most important Buddhist pilgrimage sites, it's dominated by the ancient brick Mahabodhi Temple Complex, built to mark the site where the Buddha attained enlightenment beneath a
         sacred Bodhi Tree. A direct descendant of the tree sits within the complex today, along
          with six other sacred sites, including a lotus</h2>

          <h1 id="ok"margin-left:45px;>Ancient history of mahabodhi temple Bodhgaya – the birthplace of Buddhism,
             the crucible of a new philosophy, the epitome
             of knowledge and compassion!
      <p style="color: white; font-size: small;text-align: justify;">The Great Buddha Statue also
         known as 80 feet statue is in Bodhgaya.
       The unveiling and consecration of the Great Buddha Statue took place on 18 November 1989. 
       The consecration ceremony was attended by the 14th Dalai Lama, who blessed the 25-meter statue, 
       the first great Buddha ever built in the history of India. The Statue is now a symbol of the holy 
       place Bodhgaya, next to Mahabodhi Temple which is a World Heritage site, and enjoys constant visits
        of pilgrims from all over the world. Among local people, it is nicknamed "the 80-foot (25-meter) 
        Buddha Statue."

      Under the slogan "Spread Buddha's rays to the Whole World," Daijokyo spent seven years on construction 
      of the Great Buddha Statue, mobilizing 120,000 masons in total.</p>
